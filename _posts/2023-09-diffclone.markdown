Developed DiffClone for solving robotic control tasks in an offline RL setup...

Utilized a Momentum Contrast fine-tuned ResNet50 encoder for robust representations, combined with a DDPM- based behavioral cloning agent for precise action prediction in complex multi-modal environments.
Experimented with point cloud based methods to improve representations.
Achieved a 92% success rate and a mean reward of 51 for pouring, surpassing existing benchmarks in the simulation setup.

Worked under the supervision of Prof. Artra Hazra
