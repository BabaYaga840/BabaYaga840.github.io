I contributed to the development of Curvature Informed Furthest Point Sampling (CFPS), which integrates curvature information into traditional furthest point sampling to enhance point cloud downsampling.  

Our method leverages reinforcement learning to optimize point selection by prioritizing high-curvature regions, preserving local shape details crucial for tasks such as 3D reconstruction and object recognition. CFPS reduces Chamfer-L1 distance by 22% and improves Hausdorff distance by 15% compared to baseline FPS methods.  

This work has been submitted to a top conference and demonstrates state-of-the-art results in point cloud classification and segmentation tasks.
