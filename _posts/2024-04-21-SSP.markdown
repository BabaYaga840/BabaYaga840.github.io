As a founding member of the Student Satellite Program at IIT Kharagpur, I played a key role in designing and testing the CubeSatâ€™s communication system.  

The project involved setting up ground-to-ground communication between a transmitter and receiver placed at distant locations, separated by obstacles such as buildings and dense foliage. We utilized the LORA RFM95PW module with a spring antenna on the CubeSat and a Yagi antenna at the ground station.  

Despite significant environmental obstructions, the system successfully established reliable communication, validating the antenna design and signal integrity. This work contributed to sensor integration and preliminary launch tests for higher-altitude trials.
