I developed an end-to-end navigation pipeline for multi-agent robot swarms operating in dynamic environments.  

The project involved experimenting with various reinforcement learning algorithms for multi-agent pathfinding, addressing challenges such as collision avoidance and efficient task allocation. The implemented system demonstrated robust performance across different environments, showcasing scalability and adaptability for larger swarms.
