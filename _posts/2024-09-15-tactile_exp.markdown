As part of my internship at IISc Bangalore, I developed a reinforcement learning pipeline for blind tactile exploration aimed at surface reconstruction tasks.  

The project focused on designing sequential controllers for tactile manipulation of complex objects, enabling accurate 3D surface reconstruction even under occluded or low-light conditions. The proposed system achieved up to 91% IoU for sharp-edged objects and significantly outperformed photogrammetry methods in surface detail retention.
